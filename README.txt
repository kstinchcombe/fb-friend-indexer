This was critical in April 2012 before Facebook invented Graph Search.
Now it's only a little better.

Use case: you're traveling to New York. You have 226 friends in New York
state. Now you can use graph search with "Friends of mine who live in
New York State". That's pretty good. It didn't use to do state-by-state
search.

"Friends of mine who live in new york state or new jersey" isn't currently
supported. Or "Friends of mine who have a job as CEO or President or
Director". That's fine. We can do that here.

Also you don't have to deal with infinite scroll and you can use "find"
on the page, and it's cached locally so runs like 1000 times faster than
searching on actual facebook.

Honestly, graph search is pretty much just fine. Nicely done guys!
